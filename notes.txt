Alright, need to note thing to keep them strait in my head.

1 - Managers are managers, NOT loaders.  Managers are fetch and store processors
2 - Loaders are loaders, not managers.  Managers and loaders should be separate.
3 - Thing to note is that the loader might not be able to properly store things in a manager if it's a reference.  If it
is a ref, it will be lost which will be BAD.
